This android application was the result of a class project. This sliding tiles game was built by a team of four.

Our App was built to run on the Android SDK version 26. For the most part everything was built using standard android libraries, with the exception of using Firebase to store high scores. This means that one of build dependencies is Firebase version 11.8.0. Also included are various test suites that rely on junit (version 4.12) and mockito (version 1.10.19).

Our program is hosted on Github*. In order to compile and deploy it you will need a version of Android Studio and a compatible android device (either phone or emulator). Note that the 2 player math mode will not function if your device is not bluetooth enabled.

Instructions:
1. Obtain source code from Github and import project into Android Studio.
2. Compile code. Note that you may have to perform a Gradle Sync first.
   * Compile SDK version is 26.
   * Build Tools version is 26.0.2
3. Deploy onto android device.
The instructions above were successfully run using Android Studio version 3.01.
